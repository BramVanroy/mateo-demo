# MAchine Translation Evaluation Online

**BETA VERSION**. This version is under active development and will change considerably in the coming months.

We present MAchine Translation Evaluation Online (MATEO), a project that aims to facilitate machine translation (MT)
evaluation by means of an easy-to-use interface that can evaluate given machine translations with a battery of
automatic metrics. It caters to both experienced and novice users who are working with MT, such as MT system builders,
and also researchers from Social Sciences and Humanities, and teachers and students of (machine) translation. The
project is open source and will be hosted at CLARIN.eu infrastructure.
