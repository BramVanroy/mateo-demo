    st.markdown("## üéà Goals of the project")

    st.markdown("""
- Create an accessible website to evaluate machine translation for both experts and non-experts
- Create a Python package that focuses on machine translation that incorporates both baseline and state-of-the-art machine translation evaluation metrics
- Include research-focused functionality such as custom metric options, batch processing, exporting the results to formats such as LaTeX and Excel, and visualizing results in meaningful graphs
- Integrate the website in the CLARIN infrastructure, specifically the [CLARIN B centre of INT](https://portal.clarin.inl.nl/)
- Open-source *everything*

The current demo is a very first (alpha) indication of the direction that we are taking. Improvements that will follow:

- More metrics, both baseline metrics as newer ones. We will especially focus on metrics introduced in the last two years of the WMT Metric shared task
- Expanding beyond the sentence level. For a first demo, it makes sense to show quick sentence-level evaluations but to make the tool useful for research, it will also allow for corpus-level evaluation
- Python package and documentation will be made public, as well as the final project's source code
- More visualizations options on the website (e.g., visualizing edit distance)
- Integration in CLARIN infrastructure
